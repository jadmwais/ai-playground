# ðŸ¤– AI Playground

This is a personal lab of AI tools, experiments, and learning projects built in **Python** and **JavaScript**.  
Itâ€™s where I explore the power of language models, NLP, computer vision, and prompt engineering â€” one tool at a time.

## ðŸš€ How to Run (Per Tool)

Each tool has its own folder with a `README.md` and setup instructions.  
Hereâ€™s the general setup:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install necessary packages
pip install -r requirements.txt  # or see individual READMEs
