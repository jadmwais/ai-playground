- ❌ Black-box models (you can’t see internals or weights)  
- ❌ Rate limits & pricing apply  
- 🧠 Great for: chatting, summaries, Q&A, rapid prototyping

---

## 🟨 HuggingFace Transformers
- ✅ Open-source + community-powered  
- ✅ You can download & run models locally  
- ✅ Easier to fine-tune and customize  
- ❌ Requires more setup (hardware, dependencies)
